# TODOLIST

- Implement GPU on both approaches and update the algorithm.
- Write report.
- Prepare Slides.
- Prepare demo.

# Don't forget to include this in the Report

- Take into consideration only 1 MPI Rank (fallback to sequential? or just report error? our min. is 2)
- Explain the OpenMP bug of DatabaseOverRanks and the use of TESTPERFORMANCE_NO_LEVENSHTEIN.
- Explain the bug in the sequential code: so DatabaseOverRanks could see more matches than the real ones.
- Graph of our algorithm?
- Performances read of buffer: MPI_ranks or not?
